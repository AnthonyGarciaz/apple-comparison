Here's what the chart shows:

It takes each year from 2004 to 2023 and plots how the stock price changed relative to its starting point on January 1st of that year
Each line represents a different year
All lines start at zero because the code normalizes the prices by subtracting the first day's price
The y-axis shows the dollar amount gained or lost compared to January 1st

If a line dips below zero, it means:

The stock price has fallen below its January 1st starting price for that year
Investors who bought at the beginning of the year would be showing a loss
The size of the dip shows how many dollars per share they would have lost

For example:

If a line shows -$20, it means the stock was trading $20 lower than it was on January 1st
If a line shows +$50, it means the stock was trading $50 higher than it was on January 1st

This type of chart is useful for:

Identifying seasonal patterns in the stock's behavior
Comparing performance across different years
Seeing how volatile the stock is within each year
Understanding typical drawdowns (losses) the stock experiences
